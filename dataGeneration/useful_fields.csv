Average net price for Title IV institutions (public institutions),cost,avg_net_price.public,latest.cost.avg_net_price.public,cost,integer,NPT4_PUB,,,IPEDS,Shown/used on consumer website;    The average annual total cost of attendance (CostT4_A| CostT4_P)| including tuition and fees| books and supplies| and living expenses| minus the average grant/scholarship aid. It is calculated for all full-time| first-time| degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates who receive Title IV aid. It is included in the IPEDS Student Financial Aid component. Separate metrics are calculated for public institutions and private institutions. For public institutions| this metric is limited to full-time| first-time| degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates who pay in-state tuition and receive Title IV aid. For private institutions| it includes all full-time| first-time| degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates who receive Title IV aid. The total cost of attendance depends on whether full-time| first-time| degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates live on campus| off campus (not with family)| or off campus (with family). For academic-year institutions| net price represents an average of all programs and includes only full-time| first-time| degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates who first enrolled in the fall term. For non-academic-year institutions (program or continuous enrollment)| net price represents the program with the largest enrollment at the institution and it includes full-time| first-time| degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates who first enrolled at any time during the academic year. For programs less than 1 year in length (see LProgram)| this represents the net price for the full program. This metric is not available prior to the 2009-10 academic year.
